        On 15 December 1970, nine years after the Soviet Union launched the first space probe to attempt a flyby of Venus, Venera 7 became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth. The probe transmitted information to Earth for 53 minutes, which included about 20 minutes from the surface.

Having operated for 43 years, 7 months and 7 days as of April 12, 2021 UTC, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. It is currently the most distant human-made object from Earth.
